# KAPU 

Kapu is Fork Ark is a next generation crypto-currency and decentralized application platform, written entirely in JavaScript. For more information please refer to our website: https://ark.io/.

This version is still alpha, use at your own risks

## Install, Upgrade etc...
You need to provision a linux (ubuntu tested) server (digital ocean, vultur or other).



For developers, please read below in section "Developer Installation"

## Details

This is a fork from Lisk with the following features:
- Removed sidechains (deprecated in favor of smartbridge)
- Removed custom node version
- Removed UI for stability and security reasons
- Changed some constants (block rewards, blocktime etc...)
- Added simple PBFT before forging new block
- Ditch addresses from the protocol in favor of bitcoin like system, enabling HD Wallet as for BIP32
- Completely rewritten node management using a single NodeManager and messaging system
- Completely rewritten round management (removed mem_round, reward block fees to forger)
- Added 64 bytes vendorField as first iteration of smart bridge
- Made peers management entirely in-memory for efficiency
- Strengthened the transaction management and broadcast (reject often, reject soon)
- Rearchitect with relay nodes and forging nodes
- Nodes broadcast only block headers.

### Planned features:
- Simple blockchain validation for SPV and use in lite clients
- Add IPFS as first class citizen (using smartbridge addressing)
- Protocol improvements (uncle forging, voting weights).
- Remove unsecured API
- Routing tables

### Performance
- stable on testnet at 5tx/s
- pushed to 10tx/s on devnet

## Automatic Installation KAPU Node "TESTNET"

```

```



## Developer Installation


Create New User 
```
adduser your_user
adduser your_user sudo
su - your_user 
```
Install essentials:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl build-essential python git
```
Install PostgreSQL (min version: 9.5.2)
```
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev 
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER $USER WITH PASSWORD 'password';"
sudo su postgres
createdb kapu_testnet
exit 
```
Install Node.js (tested with version 6.9.2, but any recent LTS release should do):
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm -y
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n 6.9.2
 ```


Install grunt-cli (globally):
```
sudo npm install grunt-cli -g
```
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/kapucoin/kapu-node.git
cd kapu-node
```
Install node modules:
```
npm install libpq secp256k1
npm install
```
Launch

To launch Kapu on TestNet:
```
Edit config.testnet.json  you Passrh
```
Node is running from:
```
sudo npm install forever -g
forever start app.js -c ./config.testnet.json -g ./genesisBlock.testnet.json
```
Open Ark Wallet  1.22 
```
add "http://51.15.59.104:4001" to ip field using gear icon/manage networks/new in ark wallet.

Save
```

To launch Ark on mainnet (when launched):
```
createdb ark_mainnet
node run start:mainnet
```

**NOTE:** The **port**, **address**, **genesis block** and **config-path** can be overridden by providing the relevant command switch:
```
node app.js -p [port] -a [address] -c [config-path] -g [genesisBlock-path]
```
This allow you to run several different networks, or your own private chain


## Launch your own private or public chain
Generate a genesisBlock.json + a default config.json containing all passphrases of genesis delegates
```
node tasks/createGenesisBlock.js
```
You can find generated files in tasks/
- genesisBlock.json
- config.json
- delegatesPassphrases.json (containing details about the genesis delegates)
- genesisPassphrase.json (containing the details of account having all premined arks)

Obviously you can hack away tasks/createGenesisBlock.js for your own custom use.

You can the start with your own chain on a single node (all delegates will forge on your single node) using:
```
createdb ark_newtest
npm run start:newtest
```

Then you can distribute the config.json (without the delegates secrets inside, and with custom peers settings) to peers to let them join your chain


## Tests
Load git submodule [ark-js](https://github.com/arkecosystem/ark-js):
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You should run using test configurations

```
npm run start:test
```

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

Run individual tests:

```
npm test -- test/api/accounts.js
npm test -- test/api/transactions.js
```

**NOTE:** The master passphrase for this test genesis block is as follows:

```
peace vanish bleak box tuna woman rally manage undo royal lucky since
```
